# kalkulatorAPI

## Setup environment
Download and install JDK 11 and JRE 11 from: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11&package=any&os=windows

Download and install Maven (described inside downloaded zip file):https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

Download and install Tomcat Server 9 (described inside downloaded zip file):https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi

Download and install Intelji IDEA: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows

Cause the frontend part is not done i used POSTMAN to test API calls: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## To add some calculation rules i prefere to extend classes used to exchange data about every available allowance and in JAVA just use that factors and if statements to setup limits
